_**Assistant**_

I'll check if the monitor brightness scheduler is running and stop it if it is.

---

```bash
python monitor_brightness_control.py status
```

```
(base) tylerxie@tylerdeMacBook-Air monitor_brightness_scheduler % python monitor_brightness_control.py statu
s                                     python monitor_brightness_control.py status
Brightness scheduler is running
(base) tylerxie@tylerdeMacBook-Air monitor_brightness_scheduler %
```

---

The monitor brightness scheduler is currently running. I'll stop it for you.

---

```bash
python monitor_brightness_control.py stop
```

```
(base) tylerxie@tylerdeMacBook-Air monitor_brightness_scheduler % python monitor_brightness_control.py stop
Brightness scheduler stopped
(base) tylerxie@tylerdeMacBook-Air monitor_brightness_scheduler %
```

---

The brightness scheduler has been successfully stopped.
